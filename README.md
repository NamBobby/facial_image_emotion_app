### Mobile Testing Setup (MUST HAVE):

--> Expo Go App
<!-- (Required for testing the React Native application on your mobile device) -->
- For iOS users: Download from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
- For Android users: Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

===

### Important Notes for Mobile Testing:

After successfully setting up and running the frontend application, you will see a QR code displayed in your terminal or browser. To interact with the app on your mobile device:

1. Make sure your mobile device is connected to the same WiFi network as your development computer
2. Open the camera app on iOS (or Expo Go app on Android) 
3. Scan the QR code displayed after running the frontend
4. The app will automatically load on your mobile device through Expo Go

This allows you to test and interact with the application directly on your mobile device with a native experience, instead of using the web or simulator version.
